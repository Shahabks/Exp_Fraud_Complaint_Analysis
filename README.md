# Exp_Fraud_Complaint_Analysis
Set up an experiment to compare supervised to unsupervised (done by my colleague) Fraud-Complaint text analysis deploying BERT model. No doubt that the supervised learning was improved using the labeled data, the supervised model has better Precision and Recall (0.86, 0.91) on true positives (fraud cases) than the Unsupervised one (0.52 and 0.72 respectively).
